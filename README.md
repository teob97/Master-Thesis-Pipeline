# Implementation and simulation of the pointing reconstruction model for the LSPE/Strip telescope.

This repository, together with [PRMaps](https://github.com/teob97/PRMaps.jl), contains the code used for the simulations in my [thesis](Thesis.pdf). Basically, it is a Julia port of some functions of the following Python libraries:
- [PySM](https://github.com/galsci/pysm): which allows to simulate a map of the sky to observe.
- [FGBuster](https://github.com/fgbuster/fgbuster): which allows you to perform a component separation analysis using frequencies associated with the following surveys: LSPE/Strip, LSPE/SWIPE, Planck, Quijote.

## System requirements

Once the Julia environment has been successfully activated, it is necessary to configure a Python environment containing PySM (v.3.3.2) and FGBuster (v2.0.0). It will then be necessary to set PyCall.jl correctly by indicating the path to the correct Python environment (see the documentation [here](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl#specifying-the-python-version)).

## Generate a sky signal

This pipeline can be used to generate Healpix map in equatorial coordinates like the one produced by PySM:
```
# Choose the sky model to simulate
sky_model = "d0s0"

# Choose the frequencies by using one or more instruments:
strip = read_pickle("../instruments/lspe_strip_instrument.pkl")

# Choose the maps resolution
nside = 512

# Generate the maps
maps = get_foreground_maps(
    instruments
    sky_model, 
    nside
)
```

## Simple component separation example

Below I report a simple example containing a component separation analysis implemented by introducing a systematic pointing error in the 43 GHz LSPE/Strip channel.

First it is necessary to choose which instruments you have to simulate; all of the aviable instruments are stored into `.pkl` file into the [instruments](instruments) directory:

```
using Pandas

swipe = read_pickle("../instruments/lspe_swipe_instrument.pkl")
strip = read_pickle("../instruments/lspe_strip_instrument.pkl")

instruments = concat([strip, swipe])
```

Then you have to decide the simulation setup for the LSPE/Strip telescope:

```
using PRMaps
using Dates
import Stripeline as Sl

# Choose a Healpix map resolution
nside = 128

# Choose the sky model to observe
sky_model = "c1s0d0"

# Choose the starting day of the simulation and the number of days to simulate 
t_start = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)
days = 10
    
setup = PRMaps.Setup(
    sampling_freq_Hz = 50.0,
    total_time_s = 24. * 3600. * days
)

# Choose the detector to simulate (in this case H0)
cam_ang = Sl.CameraAngles()

# Choose the uncertainties on the configuration angles
tel_ang = Sl.TelescopeAngles(forkang_rad = deg2rad(1.0/60))
```

Then you can run the simulation that reconstruct the observed signal and perform a component separation analisys:

```
(result_dict, result_map) = run_fgbuster_with_error(
    instruments, 
    cam_ang, 
    tel_ang, 
    setup, 
    sky_model, 
    nside, 
    t_start
    )
```
At this point `result_dict` contain a dictionary with the results generated by FGBUster and `result_map` contains the maps of the observed signal in the sky.

Additional usage examples can be found in the [notebooks](notebooks) folder.
